## Description

- In order to test our knowledge of hmtl/css/js, we have constructed a Javascript Coding Quiz Game.

- Leveraging the newest activities in Unit 4, we can add functionality to our app using DOM traversal, Attributes, Interval Timers, Event Listeners, Keyboard Events, Custom Data Attributes and Local Storage procedures.

## Installation
The only required equipment neccessary to play are a web-browser and internet connection.

## Usage
- Players can test their Javascript knowledge by participating in this fast paced multiple choice quiz. Players will be timed! If a player answers a question incorrectly, time will be deducted from the remaining time limit. When the timer hits 0, the game is over. Test your mettle and try to get the high score. Press Start to begin!!
